### About
A Web Application of Movie <b>Recommendation Engine</b> based on <b>content based, item-item (using Collaborative Filtering) and KNN algorithm</b>. This application will provide all the information related to that movie and the most interesting part, this application will provide you the top <b>movie recommendations</b> based on your search.<br/>The user has to first register and login into the application.
<b>HTML, CSS, JS</b> were used for frontend which was deployed using <b>firebase hosting</b> to serve the machine learning models to the Frontend.
This application uses <b>Content Based, item-item, KNN algorithms</b> to recommend movies to the user.<b>TMDB</b> API was used to retrieve all the information related to the movie and its cast. Here, feature extraction methods and distance metrics are utilised to generate recommendations.

### Algorithms Used
#### Content Based Filtering Method
Feature extraction methods such as TF-IDF vectorises the text data and distance metrics such as Cosine Similarity computes the similarity between each item by calculating the distance between each vector.

#### Collaborative Filtering (item-item) Method
In general itemitem collaborative filtering worked better than useruser collaborative filtering, irrespective of the similarity function used. This is possibly because itemitem collaborative filtering is more resistant towards user bias. Comparing the similarity functions, it was observed the plain, cosine similarity tends to work better than pearson correlation, for sparse matrices. Tried using centered cosine, but it fails when users rate all the movies same, so dropped it. The value of nearest neighbor was chosen such that the mse loss is minimized.
    * **User-based**, which measures the similarity between target users and other users.
    * **Item-based**, which measures the similarity between the items that target users rate or interact with and other items.
    
#### Collaborative Filtering Using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Collaborative Filtering Using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) kNN is used to find clusters of similar users based on common movie ratings, and make predictions using the average rating of top-k nearest neighbors.

### Distance metric
The distance metric used in this recommender is Cosine Similarity. Cosine Similarity computes the similarity of items by measuring the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multidimensional vector space. With Cosine Similarity, non-binary vector values are taken into consideration during calculation as the values directly influence the position of the vector. Cosine Similarity focuses on the contents of the items and disregards the size of the items. Hence, Cosine Similarity is suitable for text documents with different word counts.
